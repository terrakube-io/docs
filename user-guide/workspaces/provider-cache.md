# Provider Cache

The component use to execute terraform/opentofu configuration is stateless so everytime that it is executing a job will try to download the terraform/opentofu providers, in order to speed up the execution the following environment variable can be added to have a provider cache.

```
TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR=/home/cnb/.terraform.d/plugin-cache
```

When deploying the helm chart the following can be used to add an emptyDir volume to cache the providers.

```
executor:
  volumes:
    - name: cache-volume
      emptyDir:
        sizeLimit: 1024Mi
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /home/cnb/.terraform.d/plugin-cache
    name: cache-volume
```

When running tofu init, temporary files such as .terraform.lock.hcl are generated based on the current machineâ€™s architecture. On subsequent runs, OpenTofu verifies that the required providers match the architecture specified in the lock file to decide whether a new download is necessary.

However, when working locally on macOS, the architecture (e.g., darwin/amd64 or darwin/arm64) differs from the architecture used by remote Terrakube jobs (linux/arm64). This mismatch forces OpenTofu to redownload providers each time.

If you want to avoid that issue you need to run this command to generate lock file for Terrakube's image architecture.

```
tofu providers lock -platform=linux_amd64
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to use the correct size for the volume mount, in the example is only using 1024Mi, more information can be found in this [link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to use cache with EphemeralJob you will need to provision a volume with in ReadWriteMany as several jobs can be writing to the cache at the same time.
